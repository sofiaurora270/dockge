## 🔧 How to Install

Requirements:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 20+ / Podman
- (Podman only) podman-docker (Debian: `apt install podman-docker`)
- OS:
  - Major Linux distros that can run Docker/Podman such as:
     - ✅ Ubuntu
     - ✅ Debian (Bullseye or newer)
     - ✅ Raspbian (Bullseye or newer)
     - ✅ CentOS
     - ✅ Fedora
     - ✅ ArchLinux
  - ❌ Debian/Raspbian Buster or lower is not supported
  - ❌ Windows (Will be supported later)
- Arch: armv7, arm64, amd64 (a.k.a x86_64)

### Basic

- Default Stacks Directory: `/opt/stacks`
- Default Port: 5001

```
# Create directories that store your stacks and stores Dockge's stack
mkdir -p /opt/stacks /opt/dockge
cd /opt/dockge

# Download the compose.yaml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louislam/dockge/master/compose.yaml --output compose.yaml

# Start the server
docker compose up -d

# If you are using docker-compose V1 or Podman
# docker-compose up -d
```

Dockge is now running on http://localhost:5001

### Advanced

If you want to store your stacks in another directory, you can generate your compose.yaml file by using the following URL with custom query strings.

```
# Download your compose.yaml
curl "https://dockge.kuma.pet/compose.yaml?port=5001&stacksPath=/opt/stacks" --output compose.yaml
```

- port=`5001`
- stacksPath=`/opt/stacks`

Interactive compose.yaml generator is available on: 
https://dockge.kuma.pet

## How to Update

```bash
cd /opt/dockge
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

## Motivations

- I have been using Portainer for some time, but for the stack management, I am sometimes not satisfied with it. For example, sometimes when I try to deploy a stack, the loading icon keeps spinning for a few minutes without progress. And sometimes error messages are not clear.
- Try to develop with ES Module + TypeScript (Originally, I planned to use Deno or Bun.js, but they don't have support for arm64, so I stepped back to Node.js)

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

## FAQ

#### "Dockge"?

"Dockge" is a coinage word which is created by myself. I originally hoped it sounds like `Dodge`, but apparently many people called it `Dockage`, it is also acceptable.

The naming idea came from Twitch emotes like `sadge`, `bedge` or `wokege`. They all end in `-ge`.

#### Can I manage a single container without `compose.yaml`?

The main objective of Dockge is to try to use the docker `compose.yaml` for everything. If you want to manage a single container, you can just use Portainer or Docker CLI.

#### Can I manage existing stacks?

Yes, you can. However, you need to move your compose file into the stacks directory:

1. Stop your stack
2. Move your compose file into `/opt/stacks/<stackName>/compose.yaml`
3. In Dockge, click the " Scan Stacks Folder" button in the top-right corner's dropdown menu
4. Now you should see your stack in the list

#### Is Dockge a Portainer replacement?

Yes or no. Portainer provides a lot of Docker features. While Dockge is currently only focusing on docker-compose with a better user interface and better user experience.

If you want to manage your container with docker-compose only, the answer may be yes.

If you still need to manage something like docker networks, single containers, the answer may be no.

#### Can I install both Dockge and Portainer?

Yes, you can.

## Others

Dockge is built on top of [Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/). `compose.yaml`  also known as `docker-compose.yml`.

`compose.yaml` file above is great if cloning and building locally, otherwise, you can use this `docker-compose.yml` file to run docker command:
`docker compose up -d` just edit the approprite fields `[USER]`, `[CONFIG_LOCATION_FOR_DOCKGE]`, and `[PATH_TO_STACKS_DIRECTORY]`:
```
services:
  dockge:
    image: cmcooper1980/dockge
    container_name: dockge
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # Tell Dockge where is your stacks directory
      DOCKGE_STACKS_DIR: /opt/stacks
    ports:
      # Host Port : Container Port
      - 5001:5001
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /var/run/docker.sock
        target: /var/run/docker.sock
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
      - type: bind
        source: /home/[USER]/[CONFIG_LOCATION_FOR_DOCKGE]
        target: /app/data
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
      # If you want to use private registries, you need to share the auth file with Dockge:
      # - /root/.docker/:/root/.docker

      # Stacks Directory
      # ⚠️ READ IT CAREFULLY. If you did it wrong, your data could end up writing into a WRONG PATH.
      # ⚠️ 1. FULL path only. No relative path (MUST)
      # ⚠️ 2. Left Stacks Path === Right Stacks Path (MUST)
      - type: bind
        source: /home/[USER]/[PATH_TO_STACKS_DIRECTORY]
        target: /opt/stacks
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
